# CSE310 SQL Relational Database

# Overview

{Important!  Do not say in this section that this is college assignment.  Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description the software that you wrote and how it integrates with a SQL Relational Database. Describe how to use your program.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of how created the Relational Database.}

# Future Work

* Security requires improvement. This software should not be used in any commercial or professional environment.
* For a permanent installation, the SQL database needs to be stored to disk, not in memory only. Currently the program stores the database in memory, which is deleted when the program is closed.
* An internet-connected front end would make this system much more useful. With an internet-connected front end pointing to a permanent installation, users would be able to log in, log out, and log in on another computer instead of being limited to testing it locally.
